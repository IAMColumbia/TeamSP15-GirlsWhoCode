<?php 

// you could load in additional php files here, I think. So each person could have their own dev file (maybe create a dir in buddypress called dev, then I could have a file called bp-lauren.php and load it in here)

include('buddypress/dev/lauren.php');
include('buddypress/dev/danielle.php');

define( 'BP_GROUPS_SLUG', 'classes' );
